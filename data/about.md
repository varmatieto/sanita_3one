The Apps shows the relationship between `mpg` (_miles per gallon_) and some __key predictors__ available in the dataset.  In particular, it looks at the relationship between mpg and transmission type `am` (automatic / manual).

Please select a variable to be shown in relationship with `mpg`. The different shape of the points outlines the number of cylinders; the colour of the points says the transmission type .

The plot seems to show that in __small__ cars __manual__ trasmmission is better, __over__ a certain size __automatic__ is worth.
